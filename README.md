 # OBJECTIVE OF OUR PROJECT
 
 * <i> This is a AI Based game built using <b>Teachable Machine</b>.It is played using hand gestures(Rock,Paper,Scissors)
  that are classified using <b>teachable machine</b> image classifier.</i>
  
  
  
  
 # LET US KNOW HOW TO PLAY THE GAME
  
*  <i> When you open the Rock Paper Scissors game,you can able to see the option **ENABLE WEBCAM**</i>
*  <i> By Clicking the option **Enable Webcam** you will see the permission or access to your webcam.</i>
*  <i> You have to give the access to your webcam to play the game.</i>
*  <i> Since we designed the game that is played using your hand gestures so the webcam is needed for that.</i>
*  <i> The model that we builded contains three classes called **rock,paper and scissors**.</i>
*  <i> By recognizing the gesture of our hands it will classify whether it is rock, paper or scissors and displays            your choice below the class labels. </i>
*  <i> Click on the play button given above eachtime  after adjusting your choice.</i>
*  <i>Then you can see that there are images displaying computer's choice and your's choice while you are playing.</i>
*  <i> The scores of the player and computer were displayed on the top (Player Score and Computer Score).</i>
*  <i> So,by adjusting your choice you can the game as many times you want with the computer and the score will be        displayed there. </i>
